In a bowl of food processor add the entire batch of cookies ([Chocolate Wafers](/chocolate-wafers/)
(if using my Oreo cookies recipe, if not add 220g any dark cocoa)
cookies, and process for one minute.

Pour in melted olive oil and applesauce.

```
2 tbsp melted butter or olive oil
3 tbsp unsweetened applesauce (maybe use soaked dates instead?)
```

Transfer the wet cookie crumbs onto a pie plate or any other baking pan, and press firmly with the back of the spoon and with your hands.

Let it bake for 10 minutes, to firm it up a bit, and cool completely.

Mix in a sauce pan:

```
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (25g)
1/2 tsp salt
3 tbsp tapioca starch or cornstarch
```

Slowly poor in and stir:

```
2 cups milk, dairy or non-dairy (480ml) (maybe almond milk and coconut milk?)
1/4 cup liquid sweetener (maple syrup, agave or honey)

Let it cook over medium heat, and when it starts to bubble, let it cook for 1-2 minutes until it thickens.

Remove from the heat, add the dark chocolate and mix until the chocolate is melted.

```
3.5 oz dark chocolate (100g)

Imediatelly pour the filling into the cookie crust, shake it up a bit to spread evenly and cover with plastic wrap.
