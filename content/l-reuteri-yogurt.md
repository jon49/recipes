## Coconut Version

Heat to 180 degrees F

```
~1 quart Coconut Milk (Pure or only Guar Gum added)
```

Let cool to 100 degrees

Mix in small portion of milk with inulin

Mix In w/ Hand Blender

```
1 Tbsp Inulin
1 Tbsp Table Sugar
1 tsp guar gum (3/4 tsp if guar gum already in coconut milk)
```

Stir In

```
1 capsule MyReuteri (or 1 or 2 tbsp of previous batch)
```

Put contents in jars and cook at 100 degrees for 36 hours

## Dairy Version

Hand Mix 1 or 2 Tbsp of Dairy (to remove all clumps)

```
1 capsule MyReuteri  (or 1 or 2 tbsp of previous batch)
1 tablespoon inulin
```

Mix in the rest of the dairy

```
1 quart of organic half-and-half (Ultra pasteurized)
```

Heating device capable of maintaining a temperature of around 100 degrees F for 36 hours

Note: I use half-and-half as it yields the best texture and I reject the notions of limiting saturated fat and calories.
