This recipe makes 4 breads, approx 4-5 net carbs per bread. It's best to use a
scale for this recipe. I typically double this recipe.

Preheat oven to 375&deg;.

Boil

```
2 cups hot water
2 tsp vinegar (after water is boiling)
```

Mix in metal bowl.

```
2 cups (250g) ground almonds (almond meal/flour)  
7-8 Tbsp (40g) tbsps psyllium husks (fine crumbs or powder)  
2 tsp baking powder  
2 tsp sweetener  
Small pinches of salt  
1 tsp quick action yeast (optional, for yeasty flavor)
```

Add

```
1 tbsp oil
```

Add boiled water to mixture, as you kneed in more water add less water at a
time. Mix until you can form into a ball without cracks. It should be glossy and
stick together and be smooth.

Gather the dough into a large ball and leave it to rest for 10 - 15 minutes.

Divide the bread dough into four portions and shape each portion into a ball
shape. Place the dough balls on a greased baking tray. Press the dough balls
gently to create a bun shape. Coat the top of the bread dough with oil. Sprinkle
some sesame seeds.

Bake the bread dough in preheated oven (375&deg;) for 50-60mins till golden brown.
