## Breakfast

Granola of your choosing. I like the ones that aren’t doused in sugar. Sometimes the ones with dehydrated fruit already in them.

Dehydrated coconut milk is my favorite and I encourage you to try it, but any dehydrated milk will do.

Cranberries and dried blueberries!

## Lunch/Dinner

Near East brand couscous (it re-hydrates the best) I always seem to go for the
“toasted pine nut” flavoring. Usually I only use half the box for one meal.

- Sunflower seeds
- Pine nuts
- Raisins, you can never add to many raisins.
- At some grocery stores you can find dehydrated vegetables in the produce
section(sometimes called dried veggie chips), but not always. Also in the soup
section there are often dehydrated veggies made to be added to soups.
- Olive oil!! The fuel of thru hikers.
- Spice of your choice, but it’s still good without! I frequently go without. Curry powder, garlic powder, etc.
- Tuna packet on top. I went vegan 8 months ago, but this is another option for the carnivores out there.
